# Censor Ninja

## Purpose

We have developed a couple applications for people to learn more about censorship in different countries.
Both of the applications remove content from real world sources. The mobile application changes the content
of the user's Twitter feed and the Chrome Plugin changes the content of the user's webpages. We are trying to
give the user a lense to view how the internet would look if the he or she was in another country. Since it is
hard for us to actually give an accurate representation of the censorship in various countries, we have used
the 100 most common words as what is censored in our applications as a proof-of-concept.

## Mobile Application



## Web Application

We created a chrome plugin that will change the content of the website being viewed in chrome. It removes words and replaces
them with black boxes and changes the images into images of bananas. While the neither the image replacement nor the word replacement
is an accurate representation of how content would be censored, the idea is that the user will be able to see what will get censored
and how much of what they see will get censored. Ideally we would have an analyst or someone more knowledgable about the practices
of different governments in censorship help us create a more realistic experience.

In order to run the application. Open the settings tab of Google Chrome and navigate to the "Extensions" page. There you can load
the unpacked extension we have in this repository. Once it is loaded you can go to any website and turn the censorship on and off.
The images will be replaced and words will be replaced from text.
